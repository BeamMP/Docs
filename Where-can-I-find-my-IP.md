# How can I find the IP of my Server?

## For VPS Hosted Servers
If you are hosting a server with one of our partnered hosting services, the IP will be posted on the respective Server Management Interface.
You can also find the IP for your Server(s) on the [Keymaster](https://keymaster.beammp.com/login) Website.

## For Home-Hosted Servers
For Servers hosted at home, open [whatsmyip.org](https://whatsmyip.org) in a Browser.
This will output the public IPv4 address your you are being contacted with from the Global Network.

If you are still having connection troubles, check [XXXXX]:

Note that 127.0.0.1 is localhost and should only be used by yourself, if the Server is hosted on the same Computer.
