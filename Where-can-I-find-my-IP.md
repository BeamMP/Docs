# How can I find the IP of my Server?

## For VPS Hosted Servers
If you are hosting a server with one of our partnered hosting services, the IP will be posted on the respective Server Management Interface.
You can also find the IP for your Server(s) on the [Keymaster](https://keymaster.beammp.com/login) Website.

## For Home-Hosted Servers
For Servers hosted at home, open [whatsmyip.org](https://whatsmyip.org) in a Browser.
This will output the public IPv4 address your you are being contacted with from the Global Network.

Note, that 127.0.0.1 is the localhost address and can only be used by yourself, if the Server is hosted on the same Computer.
If you are still having connection troubles with your home hosted server, check (probablyup.net)[https://probablyup.net/api] and the (port forwarding guide)[https://docs.beammp.com/server/port-forwarding/]

## How to check for CGNAT?

CGNAT, short for Carrier Grade Network address translation, causes you being unable to host a server at home.
To get around this, you can ask a friend to host the server, or host it with one of our (partnered hosting services)[https://docs.beammp.com/server/create-a-server/#1-port-forwarding:~:text=our%20partnered%20Services!-,Paid%20Services%3A,-Horizon%20Hosting]!
You can also try calling your ISP. Be aware, that a *static* IPv4 isn't necessary.

For further assistance, you can open a support ticket with the BeamMP Support team on the (Discord Server)[https://discord.gg/beammp].
