### **为什么启动器被我的杀毒软件或Windows Defender标记**

Some antivirus programs may flag BeamMP as a threat, due to it interacting with the network and other stuff. There are **no viruses** in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and lua client can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/BeamMP).

### **I have poor gameplay performance, what should I do?**

We are working hard to make the Multiplayer experience as stable as possible. If you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people. (General Rule of Thumb: 1 car per CPU Thread)
