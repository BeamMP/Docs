# Issue

The Launcher can't update or shows a blank screen?
This quick guide explains how to manually update the Launcher.

!!! note

    You should have already used or installed BeamMP using the installer provided by (our website)[https://beammp.com] before continuing.

# Downloading and installing a new Launcher

1. Download the Launcher from (GitHub)[https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Launcher/releases/latest/download/BeamMP-Launcher.exe] directly.
2. Head to the BeamMP-Launcher.exe directory. By default, this  folder is placed in ```C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\``` . Replace <username> with the username of your windows user.
If you have installed BeamMP elsewhere, for example ```D:\BeamMP-Launcher```, then place the Launcher in the respective BeamMP-Launcher folder.
4. If applicable, replace the existing Launcher with the new one in the BeamMP-Launcher folder.
5. Start the BeamMP-Launcher as usual to see if it works.
