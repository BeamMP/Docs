# Why do i need to deactivate my mods?

In BeamMP, the Server you decide to connect to, provides the mods.
They get downloaded and activated automatically upon connecting.
Having local mods installed and active often leads to BeamMP not functioning properly, even if you have just one additional mod besides BeamMP.

!!! warning

    Remove any mods you have placed in the BeamNG.Drive\content\vehicles folder. That location is not for the use of mods and can lead to issues as stated in the Text file by BeamNG, which is located in the same location and reads as follows:

    !!! quote "DO_NOT_INSTALL_MODS_HERE.txt"
    
        Do NOT copy mods into this folder: it can lead to broken mods, slower installation of updates, a broken mod manager, broken Safe Mode and others.


## How do I deactivate/remove my mods?

There are 3 options to do this.
1. Deactivate all mods besides 'multiplayerbeammp' .
2. If for some reason you cant deactivate all mods trough the ingame Repo, open your mods folder in the file explorer and delete all mods permanently. Alternatively you can try option 3.
3. Open the BeamNG.Drive userfolder and rename the folder of the latest version (e.g. 0.34) to for example 0.xx_OLD (0.34_OLD).
Make sure BeamNG.Drive is closed during Option 2 and 3!
After you are done, start BeamNG.Drive via the BeamMP-Launcher and you should have 'multiplayerbeammp' as your only enabled mod available in the repository as well as the button on the Main Menu to enter BeamMP.

## My settings and configs are gone!

If you renamed the userfolder, you forced the game to craete a new, clean userfolder. You may copy the 'settings' and 'vehicles' folder from the folder you renamed (e.g. 0.34_OLD) to the new folder it created.
Make sure BeamNG.Drive is closed and replace all elements in the location you want to copy the folders to. You should now have all configs and settings as they were before.
