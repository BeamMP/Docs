# 1. BeamMP General Rules:

This includes using racial/sexual slurs or other vocabulary used to target an individual or group of people, either directly or with the intention of doing so.

This includes targeting individuals with the use of unwanted actions, unsolicited DM's or targeting them with messages, images or verbal communication.

All communication within BeamMP should be in the English language where possible, except in specific areas designated otherwise.

## 1.12 Follow all given TOS

# How to appeal actions against you:

### Ban appeals may be submitted on the forum at <a href="https://forum.beammp.com/category/28/ban-appeal" class="inline-onebox">Ban Appeal - BeamMP</a>.

All ban appeals are investigated thoroughly, involving at least two (2) members of the staff/moderation team that were not involved in the case-at-hand.  The issuing staff member will be allowed to comment, but will not be otherwise involved in the appeal decision.  These appeal outcomes are final. BeamMP reserves the right to allow or not allow members as they deem appropriate according to the [BeamMP Community Guidelines](https://forum.beammp.com/t/beammp-rules/282059), [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms), and [other factors](https://forum.beammp.com/category/28/ban-appeal).

In the event of action taken against you, you are prohibited from creating a new Discord or BeamMP account to circumvent the ban.
