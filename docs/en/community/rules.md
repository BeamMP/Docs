# BeamMP Community Rules

## *Moderators can use discretion on a case-by-case basis. Even for things that are not black and white on the list of rules. Just because something is not on the rule list, doesn't mean it can't be moderated.*

# 1. BeamMP General Rules:

## 1.01 No Discrimination (e.g. sexism, racism, etc…)
####      This includes using racial/sexual slurs or other vocabulary used to target an individual or group of people, either directly or with the intention of doing so.

## 1.02 No Bullying or Harassment
####      This includes targeting individuals with the use of unwanted actions, unsolicited DM's or targeting them with messages, images or verbal communication.

## 1.03 No NSFW Content
####      This includes content containing nudity, pornography, excessive profanity, or material otherwise not suitable for public spaces.

## 1.04 No Spamming Text/Voice Channels or Posts
####      This includes generating multiple posts or threads, spamming the same or similar messages and abusing voice communication channels or other actions that include join/leave spamming.

## 1.05 Speak English
####      All communication within BeamMP should be in the English language where possible, except in specific areas designated otherwise.

## 1.06 No Inappropriate Profiles
####      This includes profile names, photos, bios or other user-controlled content that doesn't align with BeamMP/BeamNG/Discord rules and ToS.

## 1.07 No Doxing
####      No publishing of personal information (“doxxing”) (including, but not limited to, real names, addresses, emails, passwords, bank account and credit card information, etc.)

## 1.08 No Politics
####      This includes discussing past or current world events outside of BeamMP/BeamNG or gaming as a whole. There are places for valid discussion of these topics but BeamMP is not one of them.

## 1.09 No advertising Non-BeamMP/BeamNG Content
####      This includes non-BeamMP communities, social media channels or other external links.

## 1.10 No Impersonating Staff
####      This includes claiming to be a staff member of BeamMP, or claiming to have the abilities associated with being a staff member. This also includes the imitation of staff members.

## 1.11 No Exploitation
####      This includes exploiting any bugs or oversights for personal gain or to negatively impact the experience of others.

## 1.12 Follow all given TOS
####      This is important as restrictions such as the Discord age restriction (13+) must also be followed by BeamMP players to use our Discord server.

## 1.13 Respect Everyone
####      This should go unsaid, but you need to have respect for everyone around you and act accordingly.

## 2.1 All Rules Apply
####      All rules mentioned in this document apply to the voice chats.

## 2.2 No NSFW Audio/Streams
####      Players should not stream any content that violates BeamMP rules stated in Section 1 of this document.

## 2.3 No Excessive Audio:
####      The excessive use of soundboards, playing music loudly or other uses of audio channels to intentionally agitate or target others is not allowed.

## 2.4 No Join-Leave Spamming:
####      Most users will have sound effects enabled, do not join and leave chats rapidly.

## 2.5 No Badgering Others:
####      This includes asking others repeatedly for a response after being ignored or told no.


# How to appeal actions against you:

### Ban appeals may be submitted on the forum at <a href="https://forum.beammp.com/category/28/ban-appeal" class="inline-onebox">Ban Appeal - BeamMP <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title=""></span></a>

#### All ban appeals are investigated thoroughly, involving at least two (2) members of the staff/moderation team that were not involved in the case-at-hand.  The issuing staff member will be allowed to comment, but will not be otherwise involved in the appeal decision.  These appeal outcomes are final. BeamMP reserves the right to allow or not allow members as they deem appropriate according to the [BeamMP Community Guidelines](https://forum.beammp.com/t/beammp-rules/282059), [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms), and [other factors](https://forum.beammp.com/category/28/ban-appeal).

#### In the event of action taken against you, you are prohibited from creating a new Discord or BeamMP account to circumvent the ban.
