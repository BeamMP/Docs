# F.A.Q.
List of commonly asked questions.

---
## **Client**

---
#### **How do I install BeamMP?**

There is a full guide on how to install BeamMP on Windows, you can find it [here](https://docs.beammp.com/game/getting-started/).

---
#### **Does BeamMP work on a cracked version of BeamNG?**

BeamMP does not work with cracked versions or outdated versions of BeamNG.drive. If you want to use BeamMP, you need to own a legitimate copy of BeamNG.Drive from Steam.

---
#### **Does BeamMP work on linux?**

The Client is not officially  supported on Linux. However, you might be able to get it working by running the launcher in the same proton prefix as the game.

---
#### **Why is the launcher flagged by my antivirus or by Windows Defender**

For BeamMP to be a trusted source for various Antivirus programs, a very expensive licence would be needed.
Some antivirus prgroams may flag BeamMP as a threat, due to it interacting with the network and other stuff. There are **no viruses** in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and lua client can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/BeamMP).

---
#### **I have poor gameplay performance, what should I do?**

We are working hard to make the Multiplayer experience as stable as possible. If you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people. (1 Car uses one CPU Thread)

---
## **Miscellaneous**

---
#### **Where can I find the code?**

All the source code can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/BeamMP).
