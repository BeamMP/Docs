# Players FAQ

## How do I link my Discord account?
Linking your Discord and BeamMP account is a new feature to BeamMP. To do this you will need send `!link` as a message to the [BeamMP Accounts](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/1201234743568634026/) bot.
The bot will respond with a link for you to sign into your BeamMP account. Simply sign in with your BeamMP account, once done you will receive a second message saying that it has successfully linked your accounts. ðŸŽ‰

## My game keeps freezing when other players edit or spawn vehicles

## How do I install BeamMP?

There is a full guide on how to install BeamMP on Windows, you can find it [here](getting-started.md).

## Does BeamMP works on a cracked version of BeamNG.drive?

BeamMP does not support cracked versions of BeamNG.drive nor outdated versions. If you want to use BeamMP please consider buying the game and keeping it updated.

## Does BeamMP work on Linux?

BeamMP client is not officially supported on Linux. However, you might be able to get it working by running the launcher in the same proton prefix as the game.

## Why is the launcher flagged by my antivirus or by Windows Defender?

In order to prevent Windows Defender from flagging a specific .exe, we need to buy a license which is very expensive, therefor, BeamMP might get flagged by Windows Defender.
Some antivirus may flag BeamMP as a virus because it does some interactions with network and other stuff. There are no viruses in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and Lua client can be seen on our Github.

## I have poor performance / low FPS, what should I do?

We are working hard to make performance as good as possible. Sadly, there isn't a lot you can do about it, if you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people.

## How do I get early access?

Early access (including the purple nametag and other benefits) can be obtained by either boosting the discord server or by helping to support us financially on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/BeamMP)
