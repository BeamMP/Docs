As you can see at the very bottom of the Javascript file the event is named MessageReady and will be executed by the guihooks.trigger function with the message payload and then will be pushed inside the <code>$scope.messages</code> variable to be displayed by the li tag using ng-repeat in the Html file</p> <p>The full lua file is just below</p> <p>lua\\ge\\extensions\\exampleMod.lua <pre><code>local M = {}\n\n--[[\n    This is the entry point of our extension, this is what the game loads from our `modScript.lua`.\n    In the modScript file, you can load more extensions and put them in the same directory as this file.\n\n    In this file, we will communicate with the following:\n      1.

Du solltest BeamMP wie gewohnt verwenden k\u00f6nnen.</p> <p>Mithilfe eines Code-Editors kann nun Code direkt im <code>unpacked</code> Ordner hinzugef\u00fcgt oder ge\u00e4ndern werden. Du kannst die \u00c4nderungen dann ausprobieren, indem Lua im Spiel durch dr\u00fccken von <code>Ctrl+L</code> neu geladen wird. Durch dr\u00fccken von<code>F5</code> kann die Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che neu geladen werden, falls \u00c4nderungen daran vorgenommen wurden.</p> <p>Wenn du mit den \u00c4nderungen zufrieden bist, kann dies \u00fcber Git \"comitted\" werden.

This is very important because you will need to define your variables and functions within $scope to be able to access it from the Html inside any ng-* tag. So in this example, after the <code>sendMessage()</code> function being executed from the Html it will send it to a lua file located in the extensions directory of the mod and execute the <code>modifyMessage()</code> function inside this lua file.</p> <p>An example of how the lua side could look like: <pre><code>local function modifyMessage(message)\n    message = message .. \" [Modified!]\"\n    guihooks.trigger('MessageReady', message)\nend\n</code></pre> ^ This is a simplified version of the lua to just show the function</p> <p>The main focus here is the usage of guihooks.trigger which triggers an AngularJS event defined with <code>$scope.$on()</code>. As you can see at the very bottom of the Javascript file the event is named MessageReady and will be executed by the guihooks.trigger function with the message payload and then will be pushed inside the <code>$scope.messages</code> variable to be displayed by the li tag using ng-repeat in the Html file</p> <p>The full lua file is just below</p> <p>lua\\ge\\extensions\\exampleMod.lua <pre><code>local M = {}\n\n--[[\n    This is the entry point of our extension, this is what the game loads from our `modScript.lua`.\n    In the modScript file, you can load more extensions and put them in the same directory as this file.\n\n    In this file, we will communicate with the following:\n      1.

There is no way to use the old lua with a new server, so you'll have to migrate.</p> <p>The Server's Plugin system uses Lua 5.3. This section details how to get started writing plugins, teaches some basic concepts and gets you started with your first plugin. It is recommended you read this section even if you know the pre-v3.0.0 system, as a few things changed drastically.</p> <p>For a migration guide from pre-v3.0.0 lua, go to the section \"Migrating from old Lua\".</p>"},{"location":"scripting/server/latest-server-reference/#directory-structure","title":"Directory Structure","text":"<p>Server plugins, unlike mods, are situated (by default) in <code>Resources/Server</code>, while mods, which are written for BeamNG.drive and are sent to the clients are in <code>Resources/Client</code>.

We will keep using this directory structure as an example throughout this guide.</p> <p>You also notice the <code>main.lua</code>. You can have as many Lua <code>.lua</code> files as you like.

For this, you can register a \"Handler\". This is a function which is called when an event happens, and gets passed some arguments.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>function MyChatMessageHandler(sender_id, sender_name, message)\n    -- censoring only the exact message 'darn'\n    if message == \"darn\" then\n        -- cancel the event by returning 1\n        return 1\n    else\n        return 0\n    end\nend\n\nMP.RegisterEvent(\"onChatMessage\", \"MyChatMessageHandler\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will effectively make sure that any message that is exactly equal to \"darn\" will not be sent and won't show in chat (note that for a real profanity filter you'd want to see if the message contains \"darn\", not is \"darn\").

Please be aware that the second argument is an interval in milliseconds.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>local seconds = 0\n\nfunction CountSeconds()\n    seconds = seconds + 1\nend\n\n-- create a custom event called 'EverySecond'\n-- and register the handler function 'CountSeconds' to it\nMP.RegisterEvent(\"EverySecond\", \"CountSeconds\")\n\n-- create a timer for this event, which will fire every 1000ms (1s)\nMP.CreateEventTimer(\"EverySecond\", 1000)\n</code></pre> <p>This will cause \"CountSeconds\" to be called every second.
